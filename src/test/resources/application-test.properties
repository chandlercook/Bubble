# H2 is a database engine written in Java that runs inside the application process.
# It lives within the JVM while the program runs

# Flow: JUnit starts ? Spring Boot starts ? H2 database is created in RAM
# ? Hibernate creates tables ? test runs ? program ends ? database disappears
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb


#Hibernate does this automatically:
#  Reads @Entity classes
#  Builds SQL tables from them
#  Inserts data during tests
#  Deletes the database when finished
